# WEEK 2  

Couldn't complete week 1 properly because of midsems.  
Off to a fairly irresponsible start.  
Midsems didn't go that well also wow thanks waste of time.  

Implementation has bored me. The problems are okayish i guess,  
but what frustrates me is that even though my logic is correct,  
implementing it is a pain. I'll get back to implementation later  
in the year but I'm moving on to more fun stuff.
